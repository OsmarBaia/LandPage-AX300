# FV-AX3000's LandPage
## What?
 This Landing page is a fictional product page, FV-AX3000, made with HTML and CSS only for practice purposes.

## Why?
 I decided to do a personal challenge to practice HTML and CSS without help (tutorials).
 
## How?
 I proposed myself to create a static landing page of any product from scratch, without guidance, and a finish time of 3 days. 
  
# Schedule
 - 1 Day: Concept, Resources gathering. [OK]
 - 2 Day: Initial layout and responsiveness. [OK]
 - 3 Day: Styles and Tests. [OK]

# Design
